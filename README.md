<p>We propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) decoding and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs.</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

To setup the environment, run;
```
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate EOSER-ASS-RL
```

## üöÄ SFT

The code for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is sourced from the [d1](https://github.com/dllm-reasoning/d1/tree/main/SFT).

sft results can be reproduced with the command,
```bash
# First go to the sft directory
cd sft

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 accelerate launch --config_file ddp_config.yaml --main_process_port 29500 --num_processes 2 sft_train.py --grad_accum_steps 4 --batch_size 1 --num_epochs 20 
# this results in effective batch size of 8 = 1 * 2 * 4, where 2 is the number of gpus.
```

## üöÄ Decoding Strategy: EOSER and ASS Scheduler 

The code is inside the `eval/generate.py`.

## üöÄ Consistency or InConsistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization

The code is inside the `cj-grpo` directory.

- `cj-grpo/slurm_scripts` contains the slurm scripts we used to run the CJ-GRPO experiments
- Example bash script for running the CJ-GRPO experiment:
  ```bash
  cd cj-grpo
  
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash run.sh
  ```

The code of one-step optimization (from x<sub>0</sub> to x<sub>S</sub>) is inside the `one-step-grpo` directory.

- `one-step-grpo/slurm_scripts` contains the slurm scripts we used to run the one-step optimization experiments
- Example bash script for running the one-step-GRPO experiment:
  ```bash
  cd one-step-grpo
  
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash run.sh
  ```

The code of one-step optimization with prompt masking, i.e., d1 (from x'<sub>S</sub> to x<sub>S</sub>) is inside the `diffu-grpo` directory.

- `diffu-grpo/slurm_scripts` contains the slurm scripts we used to run the one-step optimization with prompt masking experiments
- Example bash script for running the one-step-GRPO with prompt masking experiment:
  ```bash
  cd diffu-grpo
  
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash run.sh
  ```

The difference betwee MDLMs and AR LLMs during RL optimization (e.g., GRPO).

## üöÄ Evaluation

The evaluation code is inside the `eval` directory.

- Run with `bash run_eval.sh`
- The evaluation file will only save the generations, use `python parse_and_get_acc.py` to print the accuracy.
